        <h2 class="blog-heading">Intro</h2>
        <p>The core components of HTML are tags, elements, and attributes.</p>
        <p>The beginning and the end of an HTML element are represented by tags. HTML tags have a start and end character of >. These are similar to keywords, and each tag denotes a distinct idea. They could be thought of as the foundation of an HTML page.</p>
        <p>The content included within the tags is known as an HTML element. It details the webpage's overall content. It is made up of the opening tag, the web page's content, and the closing tag. </p>
        <p>The additional qualities that we want to include inside the tags are called attributes. Only the opening tag contains these. They outline the HTML element's extra properties.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-heading">Inline and Block Elements</h2>


        <p>The differences between the block and inline elements are sometimes unclear to developers. A small error in this area can result in significant issues that are challenging to find. Let's examine these two in more detail.</p>
        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p>Elements that list in one line are considered inline elements. They simply take up the area that is necessary for them, not the complete line. They don't begin on a fresh line. </p>
        <p>Some of the inline elements are:</p>
        <ul class="blog-list">
            <li><strong>span</strong> element - This is used between elements to draw attention to key details.</li>
            <li><strong>label</strong> element - This element is used to name the input tag. </li>
            <li><strong>input</strong> element - This shows as a blank spot on the website where users can enter any information required.</li>
            <li><strong>img</strong> element - This enters images wherever requires.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="blog-heading">Block Elements</h2>
        <p>Block items take up the entire width, even when they are not needed. They never have any element next to them and always begin on a new line. They acquire top and bottom margins consistently.</p>
        <p>Some of the block elements are:</p>
        <ul class="blog-list">
            <li><strong>h1 - h6</strong> elements - These are the heading elements which always start from a new line.</li>
            <li><strong>p</strong> element - The paragraph, which is written in a regular size font, is contained in the paragraph tag.</li>
            <li><strong>table</strong> element - This element makes up the table in the web page.</li>
            <li><strong>li</strong> element - Anything can be listed using the HTML list element.</li>
            <li><strong>div</strong> element - This is the container element that divides content into several parts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="blog-heading">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>From the above content, it is clear that without CSS units, it is impossible to create a user-friendly and effective website because logic and design are both crucial.</p>
